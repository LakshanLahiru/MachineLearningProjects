Obama served as a senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 before running for president. He was elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. During his time in office, Obama implemented the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. He also oversaw the killing of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the September 11 attacks. Obama left office in January 2017. Since then, he has been living in Washington D.C. with his family. He has written books, given speeches, and worked on various projects through the Obama Foundation. Obama is also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, which he received in 2009 for his efforts to promote peace and diplomacy.\n"
